Here is an update on a study we are conducting at [scidecode science consulting](https://scidecode.com).

As mentioned in our blog the scidecode team [Pablo de Castro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablo-de-castro-018905a/) (University of Strathclyde), [Laura Rothfritz](https://twitter.com/ztirfhtor) (Humboldt University Berlin), [Joachim Schöpfel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/schopfel/) (Université de Lille) and I are doing a [study on Risks and Trust in pursuit of a well functioning Persistent Identifier infrastructure](https://scidecode.com/2021/09/02/study-on-risks-and-trust-in-pursuit-of-a-well-functioning-persistent-identifier-infrastructure/) for research commissioned by [Knowledge Exchange (KE)](https://www.knowledge-exchange.info/). The project aims to identify the best possible strategic and operational paths to achieve a well-functioning PID infrastructure for KE member states and beyond. The KE partners are six key national organisations within Europe tasked with developing infrastructure and services to enable the use of digital technologies to improve higher education and research: CSC in Finland, CNRS in France, DeiC in Denmark, DFG in Germany, Jisc in the UK and SURF in the Netherlands. KE also produced a [scoping document on risks and trust in the context of PIDs](https://repository.jisc.ac.uk/8410/1/PIDs%20-%20Risks%20%26%20Trust%20%28Scoping%20document%20%2C%20ver%205.5%29%20230621.pdf). 

On the 12th of May 2022 Pablo gave a presentation with the title "Some reflections on the current Persistent Identifier PID landscape – with an emphasis on risks and trust issues" at the [CRIS2022 conference](https://eurocris.org/cris2022-conference-call-proposals) in Dubrovnik. His presentation summarizes

- the data collection through expert interviews,
- some general conclusions from the interview and content analysis,
- some key findings from the case studies we produced on the Dutch Digital Author Identifier (DAI), PIDs for organizations, PIDs for instruments, the role of funders, the International Generic Sample Number (IGSN), the RePEc Author Service (RAS) and on Failed PIDs and non-reliable PID implementations,
- some general recommendations based on our analysis.

You will find the presentation (together with an extended abstract) under [https://dspacecris.eurocris.org/handle/11366/1960](https://dspacecris.eurocris.org/handle/11366/1960).
