## New website

Eleven years after I began working as a freelance science consultant ( labelled [scidecode](https://scidecode.com/) from 2019), my consulting work is in transition, I will post about it here soon.  

In the [scidecode blog](https://scidecode.com/news) I wrote about various issues around scientific publishing and open science, the postings were not always related to scidecode projects. I now use *this* platform to blog more generally and even more detached from scidecode projects or covering topics related not to my freelance work but my work for Saarland University. In parallel, I will continue to blog on scidecode, but with a slightly different focus, as this will allow me to more clearly differentiate between consulting views and personal statements.
